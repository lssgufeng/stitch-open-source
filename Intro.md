Most of What I upload will have a compile.sh script if you happen to find one that doesn't notify me and I will upload one.

NOTE: I'm not responsible for memory leaks(not so much a bad thing as it is annoying)

Memory Leaks are where a program allocates resources for itself and then doesn't free them leaving your machine with less ram until you reboot.

Also as a friend don't run code that you don't understand especially if it looks like this.

char exp[.md](.md)="\x32\x98\x43\x23\x11\x33" etc. you get the point thats a buffer overflow exploit waiting to happen which means your system could get rooted/or if your on windows that means someone would have admin on your system.

also never run code from someone you don't know very well.(yes I realize that may imply me although I would persuade you otherwise it is good practice)
if you want to chat for a little while you can usually find me on itznitro.com my username is Core.

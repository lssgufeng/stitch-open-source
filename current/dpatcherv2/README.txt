dpatcher v2
AKA Destinia Patcher
Coded by Celtrix aka Aquertu@gmail.com
Licensed under GPL v3 see license for details

pretty much do whatever with it as long as you state that I was the original author/coder of the patcher somewhere
in your package/documentation and keep the GPL v3 license with it.



ATTENTION: Windows and Mac users you must compile it!!!!
this package comes with the Linux Binaries Only.
However this should not pose much of a problem Because I coded it with the STL(Standard Template Library)(C++).
Just Download a C++ compiler(I recommend Code::Blocks with Mingw on windows) Mac Users I assume that you will need to install
Xcode with the GCC addons for C++.)

Now open main.cpp with Code::Blocks and click the icon that looks like a Cog(gear w/e) with a play button on it. it should be ready.
now open up terminal or console w/e you call it and navigate to the folder that dpatcher is in but first
make sure that your saveX.dat(where x is 1 2 or 3) is in the same folder then type destiniapatcher saveX.dat(again X is 1 2 or 3)
after that you winscp if your on windows to transfer the file back to /var/mobile/Applications/XXXX(insert game ID here)/Documents
if you have iFile on your Iphone/Ipod/Ipad it helps greatly goto iFile then navigate to Destinia/documents click on the save
that you just uploaded scroll down to permissions and change owner and group to mobile then change the next three to Read and
write. Launch Destinia and you should be good to go.



anyhow feel free to send your thanks to Aquertu@gmail.com your thanks is great encouragement (or hatemail w/e if you feel its unethical then don't use it I
merely made it to help players with the actual story rather than online although the honor system is horrid playing normally
would get your ass kicked 600 times and you might win 10 times for a total of 250 honor which cant really buy jack crap)
Id ask for donations but I don't have a paypal if you WANT(your not required but it would be nice) to gift me some microsoft points(my account is XxG0dSnip3rxX) 
so i can get the lonsome road DLC(its 800 points I have 160 left I think) for fallout new vegas
Ill work hard to get the Skill portion working only reason I didnt include it is because Ive never gotten it to work
as I don't know the exact address range for the skills(Note: I'm not talking about the attributes such as vitality 
etc I'm talking about Power shot or other "magic skills").

If the Need For Speed Underground money cheat isn't in any of the repos Ill consider making a program for that one as well although its quite easy to patch with midnight commander(which i used to hex edit stuff).

Credit goes to SohWenTing from xSellize community for posting the picture(with the addresses highlighted) and some good information.
hacking the game wrong results in a new game and I figured out that its because it reads your save.dat as corrupt 
which makes sense as to why its starts a new game.
Ill try to get the magic skills working but I can't promise anything.

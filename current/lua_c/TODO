luac: a lua interpreter embedded in a c++ program

Fixes:
1. Fixed a error on my part to check argc first before anything else
2. Fixed the Prompt so that when you push return it displays Lua>> properly
3. minor fixes


Todo:
	Actually take advantage of having it embedded in a c++ program :p
	Turn it into something useful.

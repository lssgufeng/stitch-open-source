Lua embedded into a C program

A Lua interpreter embedded in a C program 

Uses:
- possibly as a configuration system much easier to use than an xml file
- adds a dynamic capability to the program
- adds a way to extend the program via callbacks(note: i really need to understand callbacks better)
- could easily script AI

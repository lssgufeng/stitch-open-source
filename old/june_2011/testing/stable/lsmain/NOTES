Purpose: To see if it was possible to have a window and a lua interpreter in the same process but with the interpreter in the terminal to make use of debugging
Date: July 6,2011



FIXES:

June 24, 2011: Begin Project as sdluac
June 25, 2011: forked to make maintaining code easier fork is called luac(nothing to do with the lua compiler)
July 5,  2011: Thanks to #lua on freenode.net I now realize that input can be blocked in single threaded applications
July 5,  2011: was also forked to lsmain(the current project)
July 6,  2011: Double free() error on my part didn't realize that I had called lua_close(L) and SDL_Quit() twice


FUTURE:

	Will Probably try to switch over to another GUI but I will maintain using SDL_Threads unless my boost implementation was accurate?
	most likely will be the ground for my itzporg application.
